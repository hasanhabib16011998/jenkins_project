## Jenkins project 
- generate a sample react application
- write a multistage build dockerfile
- find a optimum image to reduce size of the dockerfile
- write down the size you reduced of the dockerfile (single stage vs multistage(slim image))
- write a jenkins pipeline, 
	- should be triggered on git push 
	- it fetches source code of react from github (public repo)
	- build docker file without using any cache
	- tag with current date-time
	- push to dockerhub (private repo)
	- no credential should be hardcoded
	- use env variable as much as possible
	- then trigger the pipeline 2 and passes the image tag as parameter
	- deletes all the caches and images of the machine (clean machine)
- pipeline 2 
	- gets the image tag form the pipeline 1
	- notifies us on google chat that image:tag has been pushed 

- docker server
	- create a ec2 with docker installed
	- write a compose file

- pipeline 2
	- ssh into the docker server
	- changes the image tag from the compose file
	- starts the compose environment with no cache and in background
	- verify that image has been changed
